# Scheduling Tool

This tool is useful for creating a schedule for volunteers.

The basis is an Excel sheet with availability for volunteers.

The script runs on the availability sheet and produces a schedule. 

The current version is used to assign 2 volunteers to each time slot.

This will be helpful for when BMs are onboarded and report their availability.
